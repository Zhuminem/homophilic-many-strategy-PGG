This directory stores the combinatorial terms needed to calculate 
family partition structure probabilities for the members-recruit 
group-formation model.

For details on the group formation model, how the terms are used, and 
how they were calculated, please refer to Supplementary S2.3 of:

    Kristensen, N.P., Ohtsuki, H., Chisholm, R.A. (2022) Ancestral 
    social environments plus nonlinear benefits can explain 
    cooperation in human societies, Scientific Reports, 12: 20252, 
    https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-24590-y


Code used to calculate the terms can be found in the repository
accompanying Kristensen et al. (2022):

    https://github.com/nadiahpk/homophilic-threshold-PGG

The script used to generate the terms was

    /scripts/members_recruit/sum_product_mistakes/save_sum_prod_mistakes.py

and precalculated terms up to size n = 18 were stored in

    /results/members_recruit/sum_product_mistakes/

which are now copied to this directory here.
