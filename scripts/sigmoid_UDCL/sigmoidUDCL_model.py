        A sigmoid benefits function (inspired by Archetti (2018; Games)) combined with straw-drawing.

        Inputs:
        ---

        strats, list of str
            A list of the strategy names in the same order as strat_counts.
            Index 0 in strats is treated as the focal strategy.

        strat_counts, list of ints
            How many individuals in the group are pursuing which strategies.
            e.g., if strats = ['U', 'D', 'L'] and strat_counts = [2, 1, 3]
            then the group has 2 Unconditional Cooperators, 1 Unconditional Defector, and 3 Liars.

            Payoff to and individual playing the focal strategy (strats[0])
            (cooperators in example above) given the distribution of strategies in strat_counts
